      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        Quesadilla is a delicious and popular Mexican dish that consists of a
        tortilla filled with melted cheese and other savory ingredients. It is
        often served as an appetizer, snack, or even a light meal. The word
        "quesadilla" is derived from the Spanish word "queso," meaning cheese.
      </p>

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Flour tortillas (6 to 8 inches in diameter)</li>
        <li>Shredded cheese (Cheddar, Monterey Jack, or a mix of both)</li>
        <li>
          Optional fillings: Cooked chicken, cooked beef, sautéed vegetables,
          black beans, jalapeños, etc.
        </li>
        <li>Olive oil or butter for cooking</li>
        <li>Sour cream, salsa, or guacamole for serving (optional)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Prepare the fillings: If you're using any optional fillings like
          cooked chicken, beef, vegetables, or beans, make sure they are cooked
          and ready to go.
        </li>
        <li>
          Assemble the quesadilla: Lay one flour tortilla flat on a clean
          surface. Sprinkle a generous amount of shredded cheese on one half of
          the tortilla. Add any additional fillings on top of the cheese, if
          desired. Make sure not to overstuff the quesadilla to avoid it falling
          apart during cooking.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fold the tortilla: Fold the tortilla in half over the cheese and
          fillings, creating a half-moon shape.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cook the quesadilla: Heat a skillet or a non-stick pan over medium
          heat. Add a little olive oil or butter to the pan and swirl it around.
          Carefully place the folded quesadilla in the pan and cook for about
          2-3 minutes on each side, or until the tortilla turns golden brown and
          crispy, and the cheese is melted.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove and slice: Once the quesadilla is cooked to your liking, remove
          it from the pan and place it on a cutting board. Let it cool for a
          moment, then use a sharp knife to slice it into wedges.
        </li>
        <li>
          Serve: Serve the quesadilla hot, either as is or with optional
          accompaniments like sour cream, salsa, or guacamole for dipping.
        </li>
      </ol>
