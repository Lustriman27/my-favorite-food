      <!-- DESCRIPTION -->
      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        Nasi Goreng is a popular Indonesian dish that translates to "fried rice"
        in English. It is a flavorful and aromatic fried rice dish, typically
        made with leftover cooked rice and a combination of vegetables, meat,
        seafood, or tofu. The key to its deliciousness lies in the combination
        of sweet, savory, and spicy flavors.

      <!-- INSTRUCTIONS -->
      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Heat the vegetable oil in a large wok or skillet over medium-high
          heat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the chopped onion, minced garlic, and red chilies. Stir-fry until
          the onions become translucent and the mixture becomes fragrant.
        </li>
        <li>
          If using meat or seafood, add it to the wok and cook until it's heated
          through and lightly browned. If you're using tofu, you can add it at
          this point or later in the process.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the mixed vegetables to the wok and continue stir-frying for a few
          minutes until they are slightly cooked but still crisp.
        </li>
        <li>
          Push the ingredients to one side of the wok and add a little more oil
          to the empty space. Crack the eggs into the empty space and scramble
          them until they are cooked.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the chilled cooked rice to the wok and break up any clumps using a
          spatula or fork. Mix the rice with the other ingredients and stir-fry
          for a few minutes to allow the flavors to blend.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour in the sweet soy sauce, regular soy sauce, oyster sauce (if
          using), and fish sauce. If using shrimp paste or shrimp paste powder,
          add it now. Toss everything together until the rice is evenly coated
          with the sauces and seasonings.
        </li>
        <li>
          Adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper according to your taste.
        </li>
        <li>
          Continue stir-frying for a few more minutes until the rice is
          thoroughly heated and has absorbed the flavors of the sauces and
          spices.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stir in the sliced green onions and remove the wok from the heat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Serve the Nasi Goreng hot, garnished with fried eggs and prawn
          crackers if desired.
        </li>
      </ol>
